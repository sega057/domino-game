# Console Domino Game in Python

This is a console-based implementation of the classic game of Domino, written in Python. This project was created as a way for me to practice my Python skills as I continue to learn the language.

The game is played by one player and the computer, which has an algorithm to choose good moves. To make a move in the Domino game, you need to enter the number of the piece you want to play. If you want to place the piece on the left side of the domino chain, you should input the negative number of the piece. If you want to place the piece on the right side of the domino chain, you should input the positive number of the piece. To take a piece from the stockpile, the player should input 0.

Enjoy playing the game and feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
